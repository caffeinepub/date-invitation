# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the single-page date invitation into a playful 3-page flow with a moving "No" button that cannot be clicked.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "No" button that moves to random positions when hovered over, making it impossible to click
- Expand from single page to a 3-page flow: Page 1 (invitation with moving "No" button), Page 2 (persuasive intermediate page), and Page 3 (success/acceptance page)
- Implement creative transitions and navigation between pages
- Maintain the romantic visual theme with warm colors and elegant typography across all pages

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a playful, creative 3-page date invitation where hovering over the "No" button causes it to move away, while clicking "Yes" leads through a charming multi-page flow to a success page.
